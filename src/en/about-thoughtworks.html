                    The DDD Conference was initiated by the architecture consultants of ThoughtWorks, a leader in
                    domestic domain-driven design (DDD) thinking and practice. Hoping to provide a platform for
                    domain-driven design (DDD) practitioners, in which they can interact and share successful
                    experiences of their teams to each other, and enable Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architectural ideas
                    to be recognized by more people in the country, which enlarges the scale of Domain-Driven Design
                    (DDD) practices.
