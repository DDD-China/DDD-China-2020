But the integration of DDD strategies and tactics is another big challenge for me. We invented the aggregation canvas with our community members which smooth the coding process of DDD tactics for DDD strategies.

To introduce new technology, not only do they must research AI and blockchain, but also focus on ReactJS and Kotlin. All these suggest a changing job description for EA from companies. To respond to such changes, we can recruit EA with an evolving demand, transforming EA’s commitment to IT asset management to a commitment to maintaining dynamic IT asset. After two years of implementation, these changes also give birth to a more dynamic enterprise."
