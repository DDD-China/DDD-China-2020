        DDD Conference is organized by a group of ThoughtWorks architects, leaders of
        DDD practitioners in China, it hopes to provide a domestic platform for practitioners
        of domain driven design (DDD) to communicate with each other and share their
        successful experience, so that the architecture idea of DDD
        can be recognized by more people in China, thus forming greater scale effect.

        Due to COVID-19, this conference will be convened online. We will continue to invite DDD
        leading players from overseas to share new attempts and explorations in the field of
        architecture design in the context of the global pandemic. At the same time, we will
        also invite representatives and thought leaders from China to share their insights and
        conclusions of utilizing DDD in various scenarios. We hope that through the
        Conference, we can look forward to the new changes that will appear in DDD in the
        post-pandemic era. Although the conference has shifted from offline to online, we will
        still do our best to prepare a feast of architecture design and technical practice for
        everyone. As always, we look forward to meeting you all. </p>
