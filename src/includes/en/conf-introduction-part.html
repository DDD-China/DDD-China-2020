        DDD Conference is organized by a group of ThoughtWorks architects, leaders of DDD practitioners in China, to
        build a platform where DDD practitioners can exchange ideas and share success stories. The architects hope that
        the conference can promote the DDD idea to the public and create a greater economies-of-scale effect.

        The Domain Driven Design (DDD) Conference 2020 will be convened in December 2020. </p>

        DDD leaders from Europe and North America, as well as Chinese teams and representatives that made hard efforts
        in practicing DDD over the past year will be invited to the event to share the latest developments of the DDD
        and their experience with the community. We expect that the DDD Conference 2020 will review the progress made by
        Chinese DDD practitioners. It will provide a good opportunity for the DDD to explore the possibility of the idea
        and how the collaborative design supports fast responding in a larger scope and facilitate inter-organizational
        collaboration. </p>
