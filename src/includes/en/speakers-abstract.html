                    DDD leaders from Europe and North America, as well as Chinese teams and representatives that made hard efforts in practicing DDD over the past year will be invited to the event to share the latest developments of the DDD and their experience with the community. We expect that the DDD Conference 2020 will review the progress made by Chinese DDD practitioners. It will provide a good opportunity for the DDD to explore the possibility of the idea and how the collaborative design supports fast responding in a larger scope and facilitate inter-organizational collaboration.
                    DDD Conference 2020, here we are!
